# RBNC- A client for the reverse beacon network

RBNC is a simple system-tray client application for the reverse beacon network.
It connects to the network of monitoring stations and receives all spots. This
application allows to filter by means of the spotter distance, band, speed and
signal-to-noise ratio. This allows to filter for possible QSO partners on the
bands. Additionally, you may specify "friends" to get a notification whenever
one of those friends is active on the bands, irrespective of your filter
settings.
